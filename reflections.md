#  Artifact Reflections

##  Artifact 2: Pre-Trained Model Decision Matrix

**Customization for the Audience:**  
The matrix was created to help evaluate the trade-offs between the model size, the inference speed, and the predictive accuracy of the model among students, data scientists, and educators. The visual representation also simplifies the process of communicating to the technical and non-technical stakeholders about artificial-intelligence selection criteria.

**Lessons Learned:**  
The given experiment has helped me to understand more deeply how the domain-specific requirements predetermine the choice of machine-learning models. As an example, computer-vision models are typically more inclined towards lightweight architectures, so that they can be deployed on edge devices, and natural-language-processing models are typically required to have large memory footprints, to support contextual richness.

**Feedback and Revisions:**  
Based on peer input, I clarified the matrix, ensured that all measurements were acknowledged from benchmark sources, and included a PNG version for visual learners.

**Personal Growth:**  
The project helped me improve my comparative analytical and communication abilities, which are crucial for presenting AI solutions in collaborative situations.
